# Support our project and benefit from exclusive advantages! üåü
Our open source project grows and thrives thanks to the great support from the community. Would you like to be part of this success story and at the same time benefit from exclusive advantages? Then become a sponsor and thus automatically an insider who accompanies us on our way!

## Why become a sponsor and be insiders?
As a sponsor, you automatically become an insider and receive exclusive access to our private insider repository, in which we first publish the latest functions and improvements. You are always one step ahead and can experience the development up close.

## Your advantages as a sponsor and insider üöÄ

* **Early access to new features:** Test and use new functions before they are publicly available.
* **Influence on development:** Give feedback and actively shape the future of the project.
* **Support of the open source community:** Add to the sustainable development and improvement of the project.

## Fair use - responsible handling of exclusive content ‚öñÔ∏è
Your access to the insider repository is an exclusive advantage of your sponsorship role as an insider. In order to preserve the advantages for all insiders and to promote the sustainable development of the project, we ask you for a fair handling:

**No transfer of the code or binarys:** The code in the insider repository is still available under the co-license, but we have the request that you do not share the code, binarys or access to the insider repository publicly or with third parties.
_Why is that important?_ The exclusivity of this content is an essential incentive for sponsors and insiders. By passing on, the content loses its exclusive character, which would be unfair to those who actively support the project.

## So you become a sponsor and insider üíé

* **Visit our sponsorship page on Github:** [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/shining-man)
* **Become a insider:** After completing the sponsorship, you will automatically receive insider status and get access to the insider repository-you can get started right away!

## Your support makes the difference
With your support as a sponsor and insider, you contribute significantly to the further development of the project. You promote innovations and improvements, from which the entire community later benefits. Together we can achieve great things!

## Many thanks for your support! üôè
If you have any questions or need more information, do not hesitate to contact us. We look forward to welcoming you to our Insider community!
